# Website Traffic Forecasting Project
## Overview
This project involves building a time series forecasting model using the ARIMA algorithm to predict future website traffic. The goal is to anticipate user engagement by forecasting important metrics like page views. These insights can help businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience, optimize marketing campaigns, and allocate resources effectively.

By forecasting future traffic patterns, this project aims to solve real-world problems related to user engagement, resource management, and marketing optimization.
* Developed a time series forecasting model using ARIMA to predict website traffic patterns and optimize user engagement.
* Implemented data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation techniques to forecast future page views and analyze key metrics like session duration and bounce rate.
* Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib to create an efficient and scalable solution, improving decision-making and resource allocation.
* Applied machine learning techniques to enhance user experience and marketing strategies based on traffic predictions.
## Features
* Traffic Forecasting: Predict future website page views based on historical data.
* ARIMA Model: Implemented an ARIMA model for time series forecasting to capture trends and patterns in traffic data.
* Visualization: Visualized actual vs. predicted traffic and future traffic predictions using Matplotlib.
* Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to ensure accurate predictions.
## Dataset
Used a kaggle dataset for this project. The dataset contains the following key features:
* Page Views: The number of pages viewed in a session.
* Session Duration: The total duration of a session in minutes.
* Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who navigate away after viewing only one page.
* Traffic Source: The origin of traffic (e.g., Organic, Social, Paid).
* Time on Page: The amount of time a user spends on a specific page.
* Previous Visits: The number of previous visits by the same visitor.
* Conversion Rate: The percentage of visitors who completed a desired action.
